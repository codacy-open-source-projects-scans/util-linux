== NAME

renice - alter priority of running processes

== SYNOPSIS

*renice* [*-n*|*--priority*|*--relative*] _priority_ [*-g*|*-p*|*-u*] _identifier_...

== DESCRIPTION

*renice* alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes. The first argument is the _priority_ value to be used. The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by default), process group IDs, user IDs, or user names. *renice*'ing a process group causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered. *renice*'ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority altered.

By default, _priority_ is understood as an absolute value. But when option *--relative* is given,
or when option *-n* is given and the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then _priority_
is understood as a relative value.

== OPTIONS

*-n* _priority_|__delta__::
Specify the absolute scheduling priority (when POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set) or a relative
priority (when POSIXLY_CORRECT *is* set).  See *NOTES* below for more details.
Using option *-n* is optional, but when used, it must be the first argument.

*--priority* _priority_::
Specify the absolute scheduling _priority_ to be used.
This is the default, when no option is specified.

*--relative* _delta_::
Specify a relative priority. The actual scheduling priority gets incremented/decremented
by the given _delta_. (This is the same as the *-n* option when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.)

*-g*, *--pgrp*::
Interpret the succeeding arguments as process group IDs.

*-p*, *--pid*::
Interpret the succeeding arguments as process IDs (the default).

*-u*, *--user*::
Interpret the succeeding arguments as usernames or UIDs.

== FILES

_/etc/passwd_::
to map user names to user IDs

== NOTES

Users other than the superuser may alter the priority only of processes they own.
Furthermore, an unprivileged user can only _increase_ the "nice value" (that is:
lower the urgency), and such changes are irreversible unless (since Linux 2.6.12)
the user has a suitable "nice" resource limit (see *getrlimit*(2)).

The superuser may alter the priority of any process and set the priority to any value in the range -20 to 19. Useful priorities are: 19 (the affected processes will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0 (the "base" scheduling priority), anything negative (to make things go very fast).

For historical reasons, the *-n* option in this implementation does not follow the POSIX
specification: instead of setting a *relative* priority, it sets an *absolute* priority
by default. As this may not be desirable, this behavior can be changed by setting the
environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT, to be fully POSIX compliant. See *--relative* and
*--priority* for options that do not change behavior depending on environment variables.

== HISTORY

The *renice* command appeared in 4.0BSD.

== EXAMPLE

The following command changes the priority of the processes with PIDs 987 and 32, plus all processes owned by the users daemon and root:

____
*renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32*
____
